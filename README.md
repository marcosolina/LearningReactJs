# Learning React Js

I have decided to lear React JS and I bought [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Full-Stack-React-TypeScript-Node-applications/dp/1839219939) book and [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) Udemy course.


I'll use this repository to write the exercises provided in the book, course and possibly some mine experiments.
